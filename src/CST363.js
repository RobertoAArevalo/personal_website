                CST 363  Introduction to Database Systems (SQL)
                Course Objective:
                Database systems are used extensively by companies to store the customers’ personally identifiable
                information, sales tracking, product inventories, and by their servers connecting with applications.
                This course will provide the knowledge on how a database stores this content and how connections are
                made to databases. My company has a few database programmers and a reporting department who work with
                Crystal Reports, SSRS, and SQL to store automotive dealership sales Costco warehouse information.
                The sales reps and warehouse managers are then able to access this information.  Knowing how these
                interactions work from the backend will be invaluable to a computer scientist.
