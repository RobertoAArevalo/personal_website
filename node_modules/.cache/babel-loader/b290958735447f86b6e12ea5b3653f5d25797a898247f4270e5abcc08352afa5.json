Operating Systems covers how to use and design operating systems that are modern with an emphasis on Linux operating systems. Linux command line, writing shell scripts, and building programs with GNU utilities. GNU is software that can be used as an operating system or with an operating system. The GNU utilities that will be covered will be sed, awk, and make. All of these are on the \\u201Cuse\\u201D side. Students will be learning about the \\u201Cdesign\\u201D side as well. This will include topics such as managing memory, management process, concurrency, and file systems. Coverage of how all of these \\u201Cdesign\\u201D side topics apply to cloud computing and virtualization will be done during this class. Prerequisites/Corequisites for this class include CST 238 - Introduction to Data Structures and Math 130 - Precalculus. This is an important and useful class in the curriculum because it provides knowledge of different operating systems on both the \\u201Cuse\\u201D side and the \\u201Cdesign\\u201D side. This knowledge will be invaluable when working in the technology industry. Having experience with virtualization and cloud computing can also be advantageous when applying to companies that offer such services.
